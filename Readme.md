# IS 362 Project 1: Cycling Journey from New York to Key West

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize a cycling journey from New York City to Key West, Florida. Utilizing Python and pandas, we track the cumulative miles traveled each day and calculate the total miles ridden daily. The project is demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook, providing a clear and interactive means of presenting the data and findings.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you'll need the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/IS362-Project1.git
    cd IS362-Project1


2. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. Use the following commands to create one:

    python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. **Install dependencies**

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

    pip install jupyter pandas


## Running the Notebook

After installation, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to view the project.

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook


2. Navigate to the project directory and open the `CyclingJourneyAnalysis.ipynb` file.

3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `README.md` - This file, which contains documentation about the project.
- `CyclingJourneyAnalysis.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- Create a pandas Series object to hold the cumulative miles at the end of each day.
- Calculate and display the total miles ridden each day.
- Present the information in an easily understandable format using a Jupyter Notebook.
